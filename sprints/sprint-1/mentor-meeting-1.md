## Requirements engineering approach

- Decide on the criteria and it's priority with Anna
- Are events or number of people included matter more?
- Have clear metrics with some numbers and derive the threshold of success
  - For example, 10 events with 3 different people.
  - Or, big event like alumni meeting in uni, use it as a marker.
- see the use cases, precondition, postcondition, and alternatives; and define the misuse cases.
- use diagrams. especially, use case diagrams. (high priority)

## Requirements

- what type of events are there?
- which events and engagement are counted?
- requirements should be specific and contributes to understanding of the project.
- include requirements of previous team and start building upon it.
- consider the info that are required in the event. For example, add host contact info.

## Current status

- current status with migration is discussed same with the problem with the contact with IT department.
- The problem is that we didn't have SSH access outside of university network.

## Next steps

- consider the option of starting the project from scratch.
- consider migrating to uni github
- ask yourself a question: are you satisfied with the current product and it aligns with your future?
- define methodology for workflow on the project (like agile) and responsibilities and document it (high priority)
