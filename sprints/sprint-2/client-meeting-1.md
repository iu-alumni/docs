# Client updates

## deployment and migration

- we automated the process and waiting for the third virtual machine from uni.
- we changed the deployment process.
- we are starting to testing using workflow
- no changes for admin panel

## client

- is there a way to track statistics, metrics, ...
- this is postponed till the migration is done and everything is stable
- we will use grafana to track these metrics, some are from the application, some from the server
- in march, there are events coming that we want to use the app for and track the metrics of usage

## metrics

- previous team used yandex
- showing metrics in the admin panel?

## next steps

- fix password
- move on to profile
- users who are using the mobile app will have to update their app
- force update is not possible
- inform users about the update so it works properly and doesn't break
- ask previous team to shut their servers
- probably will cancel the donations feature, will need final approval. or implemented through t-bank or some similar bank using a small bar or button that redirects to the bank.
- authentication, when the user lost access to account and has to cover it on his own.
